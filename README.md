# Hedy
Hedy is a gradual programming language aimed at teaching programming and teaching Python. It teaches using different levels. The first level just offers printing text and asking for input. This level is meant to introduce learners to the idea of a programming language, and the environment. From there, Hedy builds up to include more complex syntax and additional concepts.

The latest version of Hedy can be found at [hedycode.com](https://hedycode.com).

What's next?

If you want to see what the core team will work on next, you can follow [our Project](https://github.com/Felienne/hedy/projects/5) or follow the [Discussions](https://github.com/Felienne/hedy/discussions).

Živjo Hedy! Привет Hedy! !Hedy سلام
------------

A great and simple way to help out Hedy is to help us translate Hedy [into more languages](TRANSLATING.md)! You do not need programming experience or knowledge to translate Hedy.

Note that at this point we only support left-to-right languages, but we are working on right-to-left too.

I have an idea for what you should build!
------------

Great! We have two ways of monitoring ideas. 

If it is a small fix, it is best to [make an issue](https://github.com/Felienne/hedy/issues/new/choose). Issues are meant for things we know that we want to work on, such as:
* Error messages that need to be improved
* Crashes or bugs

If it is a new idea, [start a discussion](https://github.com/Felienne/hedy/discussions/categories/ideas). Discussions are a place to chat about stuff we do not know if we want to work on yet, or we are not sure how to do, such as:

* New keywords
* New meanings for existing keywords
* Experimental improvements to the parser/transpiler


Want to help improve Hedy?
------------

We would love to have a few more programmers join the Hedy core team!
